# Discovering Human-Object Interaction Concepts via Self-Compositional Learning

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "[Discovering Human-Object Interaction Concepts via Self-Compositional Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14272)", which is accepted to ECCV2022.

This is the SCL code based on QPIC. Please also refer to [HOI-CL](https://github.com/zhihou7/HOI-CL) for the code of SCL based on Tensorflow
Currently we have provided the code of Concept Discovery with Qpic.

Code is preparing.

## Training and Inference

Please refer to [QPIC](https://github.com/hitachi-rd-cv/qpic) for Training and Inference. 

## Citation
Please consider citing our paper if it helps your research.
